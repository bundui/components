## Bundui

Welcome to **Bundui**, a curated collection of pre-built animated components, layout blocks, and real-world examples.

This open-source project showcases beautifully animated UI elements built with [React](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Motion](https://motion.dev). Each component is designed to be clean, responsive, and easy to integrate into your own projects—whether you're building a portfolio, landing page, or web application.

## Vision

We started Bundui because we had a hard time finding high-quality, free animated components. We realized that many other developers and designers were facing the same challenge. So, we decided to create and share this collection with the community.

## Reusable Components

Our components are built to be copy-and-paste ready. You can seamlessly drop them into your own projects to bring life and motion to your user interfaces—without having to build animations from scratch.

## Sections & Blocks

Speed up your workflow with pre-made sections tailored for specific use cases—especially in **marketing**, **portfolio**, and **e-commerce** design. Whether you're looking for hero sections, testimonials, pricing tables, or CTAs, our library will help you build faster and better.
