## Create a new project

If you are creating a new project, you can follow the instructions [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation). In its simplest form, for a Next.js project, simply run the following command.

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code='npx shadcn@latest init' />

## Start the app

<DynamicCodeBlock lang="ts" code={`cd my-app\n\nnpm run dev`} />
