# 3D Tilt Effect

The 3D Tilt Effect is an interactive visual technique that makes cards or images respond to mouse movements, creating a perspective effect. When a user moves their cursor over the card, it appears to tilt as if it were a 3D object. This effect is achieved through mouse tracking and perspective transform techniques, allowing the card to subtly bend in response to the userâ€™s actions.
