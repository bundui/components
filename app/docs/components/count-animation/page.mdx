# Count Animation

The count animation component is designed to create a captivating user experience by animating numerical values as they increase or decrease. This effect draws the user's attention to important data, making the information more dynamic and engaging. Whether it's displaying statistics, financial figures, or progress counters, the smooth animation of numbers adds a sense of liveliness and interactivity to your interface. This example was created using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion.
