# Animated Gradient Text

Animated gradient text is a UI component designed to be visually striking and engaging. As the user reads the text, the colors smoothly transition, creating a dynamic and captivating effect compared to static text. This type of text is especially effective when used for headings or important highlights, enhancing interaction and adding a modern touch to the user experience. This example was created using Tailwind CSS.
