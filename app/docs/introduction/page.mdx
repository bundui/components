# Bundui

Welcome to our component collection. In this collection you will find pre-built animated components, blocks and real-world examples.

This is a project dedicated to showcasing animated components built with **Framer Motion** and **Tailwind CSS**. This collection is a repository of reusable components designed to enhance your web applications or websites with beautiful, fluid animations.

## Vision

We created this project because we were struggling to find high quality and free components, and we thought that other people might need something like this, so we decided to share it as open source.

### Reusable components

We create components that you can effortlessly copy and paste into your project. You can use it to make your project more engaging and grab people's attention.

### Templates

This is something we are planning in the near future. Using the animated components and blocks we have created, we will create websites that will respond to basic needs.

### Sections

Build faster with pre-built sections that serve a specific purpose. These components are especially needed in the marketing and e-commerce category.
