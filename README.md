# Bundui

Welcome to our component collection. In this collection you will find pre-built animated components, blocks and real-world examples.

This is a project dedicated to showcasing animated components built with Framer Motion and Tailwind CSS. This collection is a repository of reusable components designed to enhance your web applications or websites with beautiful, fluid animations.

**This project is still in beta phase. Some content may be changed or deleted. Keep in mind that we are constantly trying to keep this place updated.**
